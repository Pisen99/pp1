                Red wine:
                <br>
                We’ve all been there.. <br> Accidentally knocking down a 
                glass on the table spilling the red wine all over the
                table cloth. <br> No worries we’ll fix this, your great
                grandma's table cloth will be just fine.
                <br>
                <br>
                How do we fix this?
                <br>
                Rinse the table cloth under water and pour some salt on it,
                don’t be shy with the salt. <br> The salt will absorb the red wine,
                you could also use potato stash or bicarbonate. <br> After roughly
                30 minutes scrape the salt off and the stain should be gone.
                <br> If it isn’t put it in the laundry machine and let that do
                the rest, this works every time for me!

                Oil or fat:
                <br>
                This is my favourite and probably the easiest stain to fix. <br>
                Spilling oil on a piece of clothing is very common, maybe 
                you did it when cooking or eating.. <br> So how
                do we fix this without throwing your favourite shirt away?
                <br>
                <br>
                How do we fix this?
                <br>
                We all have it in the kitchen, "washing up liquid". <br> This is fat
                repellant and will absorb most fat stains. <br> Pour some hot water
                on the stain and a lot of washing up liquid for you to scrub in. <br> Let sit for
                roughly 15 minutes and then rinse off. <br> The stain should be
                gone once the piece of clothing has dried. <br> One of the best
                brands to use for this is the Swedish brand “YES”.

                    Stearin:
                    <br>
                    Knocked over a candle and the stearin melts into the table cloth?
                    <br> No worries all you have to do is put it in the freezer for a bit then scrape
                    the stearin off. <br> Or you could use a coffee filter and a steamer.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    How do we fix this?
                    <br>
                    Take out your steamer and put some coffee filters under and above
                    the stain on your table cloth. <br> Use the steamer to melt the
                    stearin all over again but this time the coffee filters will absorb the
                    stearin instead. <br> You might have to change filter more often
                    depending on the stain size. <br> Reglate the heat so no firer will occur.

                Coughing:
                <br>
                Coughing late in the night and can’t sleep, I know the feeling.. <br>
                There is hope for you, just make sure you have 1 or 2 yellow onions
                at home.
                <br>
                <br>
                How do we fix this?
                <br>
                Bring out a big bowl and start boiling some water in the background. <br>
                Take the onion, slice each onion about 4 times and put it in the bowl. <br>
                Pour a decent amount of hot water over the onion. <br>
                Leave the steamed onion next to your bed for when you go to bed. <br>
                It might smell a little bit but you will get that sleep back, it’ll be worth it. <br>

                Throath pain:
                <br>
                Is your throat hurting, googling late at night desperate for help.. <br>
                Making your own saltwater and rinsing your mouth with it might help
                a little bit, but does it take the pain away?
                <br>

                Put on a ginger tea with honey, warm and soothing for your throat. <br>
                The ginger is good for your immune system and will help to boost 
                it back up again, allowing your body to defeat it a little bit faster. <br>
                Another tip is using snus, it’s very common in
                Sweden to use tobacco under your lip rather than smoking a cigarette. <br>
                This pro tip comes from north of Sweden,
                snus in will help numbing your throat when you swallow your saliva. <br>
                I would only recommend it to people who use snus on regular basis, but it does
                take the pain away.

                Coca-Cola (original) works good when you're feeling nauseous. <br>
                Taking small sips and breathing will help with your car sickness. <br>
                Coca Cola has enough sugar in it to make you nauseous on it's own. <br>
                To fight this problem, Coca-Cola adds a substance to fight it. <br>
                Therefore, Coca-Cola will prevent you from getting nauseous thanks
