      The navigation bar has a simple and easy navigation to it on all devices.
      It´s easy to find the different locators like "Stains", "Feeling sick?" "Sidney Rez" and "Sign-Up".
      It lights up when the user hovers over the text, making it easier for them to see what part they might klick on.

      The main image is used to point out what vibe the site is giving out.
      A lightbulp with a bright light giving the impression that this website has a "Idea" or a "solution" to something.

## Design

### Imagery
    I wanted the whole page to have one common thread.
    When menu is hovered over, color yellow will appear to be the same as the hero image.
    The brown in the main image goes well togheter with the other colors on the page.


### Sections
    I wanted the most important content to be closer to the top of the page.
    By dividing up paragraphs in boxes using border color and box shadowing it's easier to read.
    
      
### Color Scheme
    Using 3 different shades of brown to have a red-thread in the website.
    Only yellow is used in hero image and the hover color for the menu.

### Typography
    I wanted to use a fun font for my header, h1/h2´s and a more serious one for the text content in the rest of the page.
    The colors are soft to the eye and goes well togheter.
      

### Media query
    Making the website match on different tablets from 320px and up to 3820px.
    Using flexbox in css making it easier to write the media queries making the code shorter and more readable.

## Tests

### Validator test
      
* ### HTML:
    * Trying to pass my code in HTML the first time gave me 1 warning and 1 error. It was an easy fix to these problems. I removed width and height from Iframe video in HTML. Writing the styling in css instead and removing the frameboard compleatly from the video. I'll insert a before picture along with a after picture when code is fixed.
