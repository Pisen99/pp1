## Design

### Imagery
    I wanted the whole page to have one common thread.
    When menu is hovered over, color yellow will appear to be the same as the hero image.
    The brown in the main image goes well togheter with the other colors on the page.


### Sections
    I wanted the most important content to be closer to the top of the page.
    By dividing up paragraphs in boxes using border color and box shadowing it's easier to read.
    
      
### Color Scheme
    Using 3 different shades of brown to have a red-thread in the website.
    Only yellow is used in hero image and the hover color for the menu.

### Typography
    I wanted to use a fun font for my header, h1/h2´s and a more serious one for the text content in the rest of the page.
    The colors are soft to the eye and goes well togheter.
      
### Media query
    Making the website match on different tablets from 320px and up to 3820px.
    Using flexbox in css making it easier to write the media queries making the code shorter and more readable.
